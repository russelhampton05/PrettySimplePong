[S-1] Mission

	I've been learning a lot in school and through my work with various companies and I decided to try and write something simply and as 
beautifully as possible. I believe that programming can be an art and a craft, and I hope that through the course of this project I get just a little 
bit better. I wanted to write something I wasn't ashamed to show anyone who cared to see. In that spirit, I've also decided to commit
almost every step of the way to show the whole process.
