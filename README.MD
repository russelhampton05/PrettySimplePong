Pretty, Simple, Pong

Disclaimer:

This was written using a student's copy of Visual Studio 2013 and the SFML libraries for the GUI. 
It is my own whole work. This was written during my first semester senior year of my computer science degree. Written in the
winter of 2015.

This code is free for anyone to use in any way.

Paddles can move in 8 directions. Balls can bounce off of the back of paddles. The game does not end when a ball hits an edge.

P will pause the game. Pressing ESC will bring up the menu. 


Future Plans:

If I ever come back to this project, I'd like to make a tcp/ip multiplayer feature.
